### PLAYERS: CREATE CHARACTERS
1. Choose a style for your character: 
    - **Enthusiastic**
    - **Rock-Star**
    - **Greedy**
    - **Adventurous** 
    - **Nerdy**
    - **Jaded**
    - **Skeptical**
2. Choose a role for your character:
    - **Park Staff**
    - **Lab Technician**
    - **Big Game Hunter**
    - **Paleo-Expert**
    - **Philosophiser**
    - **Suit**
    - **Kid**
3. Choose your **number,** from **2** to **5**. A low number means you’re better at **CHAOS** (intuition; survival; speeches; quick thinking; wild, passionate action). A high number means you’re better at **THEORY** (science; technology; rationality; planning; calm, precise action). 
4. Give your character a **cool dinosaur adventure name.**

**You have:**
- **a radio,** that works most of the time
- **a park map,** whose accuracy is in doubt
- **an instant camera,** with limited film
- **a park badge,** which should let you through some doors
- **a flashlight,** with new-ish batteries

**Player goal:** Get your character involved in some crazy dino survival adventures and try to make the best of them.

**Character goal:** Choose one or create your own:
  - **See Dinos Up Close**
  - **Kill Dinos**
  - **Enjoy Your Vacation**
  - **Finish Your Research**
  - **Prove You Were Right**
  - **Find a Way to Market This**

### PLAYERS: CREATE THE TOUR VEHICLE
As a group, pick two strengths for your Tour Vehicle:
  - **Fast**
  - **Tight Turns**
  - **Strong**
  - **Well-Stocked**
  - **Well-Armed**
  - **All-Terrain**
  - **Amphibious**
Also pick one problem:
  - **Fuel Hog** (always runs out of gas)
  - **Used First-Aid Kit** (just like, a few bandaids and a tongue-depressor)
  - **Faulty Ignition** (doesn’t always start up the first time)

### ROLLING THE DICE
When you do something risky, roll **1d6** to find out how it goes. Roll **+1d** if you’re prepared and **+1d** if you’re an expert. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll based on your character and the situation.)
Roll your dice and compare each die result to your **number.**

**⤊** - If you’re using **CHAOS** (survival, passion), you want to roll **above your number.**

**⤋** - If you’re using **THEORY** (planning, reason), you want to roll **below your number.**

**0 - If none of your dice succeed,** it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.
    
**1 - If one die succeeds,** you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.

**2 - If two dice succeed,** you do it well. Good job!

**3 - If three dice succeed,** you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get.

**! - If you roll your number exactly,** you get _**CHAOS THEORY!**_ You get a special insight into what’s going on. Ask the GM a question, and they’ll answer you honestly. Some good questions:
  - What should I be on the lookout for?
  - What’s the best way to \_\_\_\_?
  - What/who caused this?
  
You can change your action if you want to, then roll again.
Helping: If you want to help someone else who’s rolling, say how you try to help them, and make a roll. If you succeed, give them +1d.
